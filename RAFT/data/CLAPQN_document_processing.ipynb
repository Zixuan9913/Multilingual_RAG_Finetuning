In addition , ACFA recognizes Russian Shorthairs in white , black , and blue . Domestic cat The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a darker , slate grey . They develop close bonds with their owners and are sought out as pets due to their personalities , beauty and coat . It is their short , dense coat which has been the hallmark of the Russian breed for more than a century . The dense coat stands out from the body and one can draw patterns in the coat that will stay until one smoothes them out again . They are also considered to be hypoallergenic . Contents 1 Origin 2 Physical characteristics 3 Behavioral characteristics 4 Growth and maturity 5 Allergies 6 In popular culture 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Origin The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangel'sk in Russia . They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues . It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s . The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat . The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912 , when it was given its own class . The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II . Right after the war , a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese . Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war , it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today . This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues . The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out . The short hair and slate - gray / blue color is often seen in mixed - breed cats , which can affect breeders and showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue . Russian Blues are plush short - haired , shimmering pale blue - gray cats with emerald green eyes . Guard hairs are distinctly silver - tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance . They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung . They are being used in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in FIFe . Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were created from crosses with domestic white cats which were allegedly imported from Russia . The first line was developed by Frances McLeod in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis Jones in Australia in the 1970s . By the late 1970s , the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in the United Kingdom as Russian cats . However , the Cat Fanciers ' Association and FIFe does not recognize any variation of the Russian Blue . Physical characteristics 4 -- 5 month - old Russian Blue kittens 2 month - old CFA Russian Blue The Russian Blue has bright green eyes , pinkish lavender or mauve paws , two layers of short thick fur , and a blue - grey coat . The color is a bluish - gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene . However , as dilute genes are recessive and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes two non-CPC Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat . Due to the breeding with Siamese after World War II , there are colorpoint genes floating around . If two carriers are bred together , then they will produce a litter of mixed colors -- solid blue or white with blue like a Siamese . People call these CPC cats `` colorpoint '' , `` whites '' or `` pointed '' Russians . In most registries , one can not register , breed or show a colorpoint Russian . The coat is known as a `` double coat '' , with the undercoat being soft , downy and equal in length to the guard hairs , which are an even blue with silver tips . However , the tail may have a few very dull , almost unnoticeable stripes . The coat is described as thick , plush and soft to the touch . The feeling is softer than the softest silk . The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance . Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green . Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats . Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues , nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats , although they have similar traits . Behavioral characteristics A Russian Blue male Russian Blue 's green eyes The Russian Blue is a curious and tranquil animal . They are known for their friendliness and intelligence and are somewhat reserved . They have been known to play fetch , open doors and are sensitive to human emotions . They enjoy playing with a variety of toys and develop loyal bonds to their loved ones and other family pets . They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions . They are clean animals that are normally reserved around strangers , unless they are brought up in an active household . Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks . They can also be fierce hunters , often catching rodents , birds , rabbits , small mammals , or reptiles . Russian Blue kittens are energetic and require adequate playmates or toys as they can become mischievous if bored . They have exceptional athleticism and rival even Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb . Slow to mature , Russian Blues retain many of their adolescent traits both good and otherwise until they are 3 -- 4 years old and even much older Blues can be easily enticed into play by their owners . Russian Blues are also as mentioned above highly intelligent , they have an excellent memory and will learn the hiding place of favourite toys and lead their owners to them when they want a game . They also have a keen ability to remember favourite visitors and will race to greet familiar faces even if quite some time has passed between visits -- a radical departure from their normally very reserved behaviour around unfamiliar people . Growth and maturity Russian Blues have a life expectancy of around 10 -- 20 years , but some have even lived up to a maximum of 25 years and have few health problems as they tend to have little to no genetic problems and are not prone to illness . They are small to moderate - sized cats with an average weight of 2.27 to 5.45 kg when full grown . Males will typically be larger than females . Their gestation period is approximately 64 days . Allergies See also : Allergy to cats \\u00a7 Hypoallergenic cats Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies . There is speculation that the Russian Blue produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1 , one source of cat allergies . The thicker coat may also trap more of the allergens closer to the cat 's skin . Glycoprotein is one source of cat allergies , but this does not mean they are suitable to be homed with people allergic to cats as they will still cause the allergy to be affected , only to a lesser degree for short periods of time .

Developed in reaction to World War I , the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic , reason , and aestheticism of modern capitalist society , instead expressing nonsense , irrationality , and anti-bourgeois protest in their works . The art of the movement spanned visual , literary , and sound media , including collage , sound poetry , cut - up writing , and sculpture . Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence , war , and nationalism , and maintained political affinities with the radical left . Cover of the first edition of the publication Dada by Tristan Tzara ; Z\\u00fcrich , 1917 There is no consensus on the origin of the movement 's name ; a common story is that the Austrian artist Richard Huelsenbeck plunged a knife at random into a dictionary , where it landed on `` dada '' , a colloquial French term for a hobby horse . Others note that it suggests the first words of a child , evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group . Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning in any language , reflecting the movement 's internationalism . The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant - garde . The term anti-art , a precursor to Dada , was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art . Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement 's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention . The work of French poets , Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada 's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning . Works such as Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto - Dadaist works . The Dada movement 's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball 's Dada Manifesto in 1916 . The Dadaist movement included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art / literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Marcel Duchamp , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Man Ray , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , Max Ernst , and Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant - garde and downtown music movements , and groups including Surrealism , nouveau r\\u00e9alisme , pop art and Fluxus .

De Zayas ! Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont - Euxin , New York , 1915 Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity -- in art and more broadly in society -- that corresponded to the war . Avant - garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen Cubist exhibitions held at Galeries Dalmau , Barcelona , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin , the Armory Show in New York , SVU M\\u00e1nes in Prague , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches . Many Dadaists believed that the ' reason ' and ' logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . '' According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend . As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . '' A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . '' Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege . '' To quote Dona Budd 's The Language of Art Knowledge , Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War . This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Z\\u00fcrich . Dada rejected reason and logic , prizing nonsense , irrationality and intuition . The origin of the name Dada is unclear ; some believe that it is a nonsensical word . Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara 's and Marcel Janco 's frequent use of the words `` da , da , '' meaning `` yes , yes '' in the Romanian language . Another theory says that the name `` Dada '' came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French -- German dictionary happened to point to ' dada ' , a French word for ' hobbyhorse ' . The movement primarily involved visual arts , literature , poetry , art manifestos , art theory , theatre , and graphic design , and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works .

Some sources state that Dada coalesced on October 6 at the Cabaret Voltaire . Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Z\\u00fcrich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe , particularly Romania , that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish modernist artists settled in Z\\u00fcrich . In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities ; it is likely that Dada 's catalyst was the arrival in Z\\u00fcrich of artists like Tzara and Janco . Having left Germany and Romania during the Great War , the artists found themselves in Switzerland , a country recognized for its neutrality . Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social , political , and cultural ideas of that time . The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society , a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the status quo . Janco recalled , `` We had lost confidence in our culture . Everything had to be demolished . We would begin again after the tabula rasa . At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense , public opinion , education , institutions , museums , good taste , in short , the whole prevailing order . '' The Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public soir\\u00e9e at Waag Hall on July 14 , 1916 , Ball recited the first manifesto . In 1917 , Tzara wrote a second Dada manifesto considered one of the most important Dada writings , which was published in 1918 . Other manifestos followed . A single issue of the magazine Cabaret Voltaire was the first publication to come out of the movement . After the cabaret closed down , Dada activities moved on to a new gallery , and Hugo Ball left for Bern . Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas . He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters , and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist . The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened , and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf . Z\\u00fcrich Dada , with Tzara at the helm , published the art and literature review Dada beginning in July 1917 , with five editions from Z\\u00fcrich and the final two from Paris . Other artists , such as Andr\\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault , created `` literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada . '' After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918 , most of the Z\\u00fcrich Dadaists returned to their home countries , and some began Dada activities in other cities . Others , such as the Swiss native Sophie Taeuber , would remain in Z\\u00fcrich into the 1920s . Berlin Cover of Anna Blume , Dichtungen , 1919 `` Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers , of mounting , thundering hunger , where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust , and men 's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence ... Fear was in everybody 's bones `` - Richard H\\u00fclsenbeck The groups in Germany were not as strongly anti-art as other groups . Their activity and art were more political and social , with corrosive manifestos and propaganda , satire , public demonstrations and overt political activities . The intensely political and war - torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists . Conversely , New York 's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically - driven , less political nature . In February 1918 , while the Great War was approaching its climax , Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin , and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year . Following the October Revolution in Russia , by then out of the war , Hannah H\\u00f6ch and George Grosz used Dada to express communist sympathies . Grosz , together with John Heartfield , H\\u00f6ch and Hausmann developed the technique of photomontage during this period . After the war , the artists published a series of short - lived political magazines and held the First International Dada Fair , ' the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists ' , in the summer of 1920 . As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada -- Grosz , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Huelsenbeck and Heartfield -- the exhibition also included the work of Otto Dix , Francis Picabia , Jean Arp , Max Ernst , Rudolf Schlichter , Johannes Baargeld and others . In all , over 200 works were exhibited , surrounded by incendiary slogans , some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi 's Entartete Kunst exhibition in 1937 . Despite high ticket prices , the exhibition lost money , with only one recorded sale . The Berlin group published periodicals such as Club Dada , Der Dada , Everyman His Own Football , and Dada Almanach . Cologne In Cologne , Ernst , Baargeld , and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments . Cologne 's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub , and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a communion dress . The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity , but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped . Marcel Duchamp , Fountain , 1917 ; photograph by Alfred Stieglitz New York Main article : New York Dada Like Z\\u00fcrich , New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War . Soon after arriving from France in 1915 , Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia met American artist Man Ray . By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical anti-art activities in the United States . American Beatrice Wood , who had been studying in France , soon joined them , along with Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven . Arthur Cravan , fleeing conscription in France , was also in New York for a time . Much of their activity centered in Alfred Stieglitz 's gallery , 291 , and the home of Walter and Louise Arensberg . The New Yorkers , though not particularly organized , called their activities Dada , but they did not issue manifestos . They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as The Blind Man , Rongwrong , and New York Dada in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for museum art . New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor . In his book Adventures in the arts : informal chapters on painters , vaudeville and poets Marsden Hartley included an essay on `` The Importance of Being ' Dada ' '' . Rrose S\\u00e9lavy , the alter ego of Dadaist Marcel Duchamp During this time Duchamp began exhibiting `` readymades '' such as a bottle rack , and was active in the Society of Independent Artists . In 1917 he submitted the now famous Fountain , a urinal signed R. Mutt , to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece . First an object of scorn within the arts community , the Fountain has since become almost canonized by some as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture . Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 Turner Prize , Gordon 's gin , voted it `` the most influential work of modern art '' . As recent scholarship documents , the work is likely more collaborative than it has been given credit for in twentieth - century art history . Duchamp indicates in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work . As he writes : `` One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture . '' The piece is more in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp 's friend and neighbour , the Baroness Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven , than Duchamp 's . In an attempt to `` pay homage to the spirit of Dada '' a performance artist named Pierre Pinoncelli made a crack in a replica of The Fountain with a hammer in January 2006 ; he also urinated on it in 1993 . Picabia 's travels tied New York , Z\\u00fcrich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period . For seven years he also published the Dada periodical 391 in Barcelona , New York City , Z\\u00fcrich , and Paris from 1917 through 1924 . By 1921 , most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation . Paris Man Ray , c. 1921 -- 22 , Rencontre dans la porte tournante , published on the cover of Der Sturm , Volume 13 , Number 3 , 5 March 1922 Man Ray , c. 1921 -- 22 , Dessin , published on page 43 of Der Sturm , Volume 13 , Number 3 , 5 March 1922 The French avant - garde kept abreast of Dada activities in Z\\u00fcrich with regular communications from Tristan Tzara , who exchanged letters , poems , and magazines with Guillaume Apollinaire , Andr\\u00e9 Breton , Max Jacob , Cl\\u00e9ment Pansaers , and other French writers , critics and artists . Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century . One of its practitioners , Erik Satie , collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad , scandalous ballet called Parade . First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917 , it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky 's Le Sacre du printemps had done almost five years earlier . This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself , something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with . Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there . Inspired by Tzara , Paris Dada soon issued manifestos , organized demonstrations , staged performances and produced a number of journals The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the Salon des Ind\\u00e9pendants in 1921 . Jean Crotti exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled , Explicatif bearing the word Tabu . In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play The Gas Heart to howls of derision from the audience . When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production , the play provoked a theatre riot that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce Surrealism . Tzara 's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his `` ironic tragedy '' Handkerchief of Clouds in 1924 . Netherlands In the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around Theo van Doesburg , best known for establishing the De Stijl movement and magazine of the same name . Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry , and included poems from many well - known Dada writers in De Stijl such as Hugo Ball , Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters . Van Doesburg and Thijs Rinsema became friends of Schwitters , and together they organized the so - called Dutch Dada campaign in 1923 , where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada , Schwitters read his poems , Vilmos Husz\\u00e1r demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg , played avant - garde compositions on piano . A Bonset sound - poem , `` Passing troop '' , 1916 Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in De Stijl , although under a pseudonym , I.K. Bonset , which was only revealed after his death in 1931 . ' Together ' with I.K. Bonset , he also published a short - lived Dutch Dada magazine called M\\u00e9cano . Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H.N. Werkman , who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine , The Next Call . Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German - born and eventually settled in the Netherlands . These were Otto van Rees , who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Caf\\u00e9 Voltaire in Z\\u00fcrich , and Paul Citroen . Georgia Although Dada itself was unknown in Georgia until at least 1920 , from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves `` 41st Degree '' organized along Dadaist lines . The most important figure in this group was Iliazd , whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists . After his flight to Paris in 1921 , he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events . Yugoslavia In Yugoslavia there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922 , run mainly by Dragan Aleksi\\u0107 and including work by Mihailo S. Petrov , Zenitism 's two brothers Ljubomir Mici\\u0107 and Branko Ve Poljanski . Aleksi\\u0107 used the term `` Yougo - Dada '' and is known to have been in contact with Raoul Hausmann , Kurt Schwitters , and Tristan Tzara . Italy The Dada movement in Italy , based in Mantua , was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art . It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome , featuring paintings , quotations from Tristan Tzara , and original epigrams such as `` True Dada is against Dada '' . The most notable member of this group was Julius Evola , who went on to become an eminent scholar of occultism , as well as a right - wing philosopher and an assistant to Benito Mussolini . Japan Dada , an iconic character from the Ultra Series . His design draws inspiration from the art movement . A prominent Dada group in Japan was MAVO , founded in July 1923 by Tomoyoshi Murayama and Yanase Masamu . Other prominent artists were Jun Tsuji , Eisuke Yoshiyuki , Shinkichi Takahashi and Katsue Kitasono . In the Tsuburaya Productions 's Ultra Series , an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement , with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 tokusatsu series , Ultraman , and was designed by character artist Toru Narita . Dada 's design is primarily monochromatic , and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes , as a reference to the movement . On May 19 , 2016 , in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo , the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher . Russia This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia , however , avant - garde art was widespread due to the Bolshevik 's revolutionary agenda . The Nichevoki , a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that Vladimir Mayakovsky should go to the `` Pampushka '' on the `` Tverbul '' to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it , after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature . Poetry , music and sound Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts ; its influence reached into sound and music . Kurt Schwitters developed what he called sound poems , while Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont - Dessaignes composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920 . Other composers such as Erwin Schulhoff , Hans Heusser and Alberto Savinio all wrote Dada music , while members of Les Six collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings . Erik Satie also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career , although he is primarily associated with musical Impressionism . In the very first Dada publication , Hugo Ball describes a `` balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk - songs . '' African music and jazz were common at Dada gatherings . Marc Lowenthal , in I Am a Beautiful Monster : Poetry , Prose , and Provocation , writes : Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry , a starting point for performance art , a prelude to postmodernism , an influence on pop art , a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho - political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for Surrealism . Musician Frank Zappa was a self - proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement : In the early days , I did n't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of . You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea -- AND a nice , short name for it . Legacy The Janco Dada Museum , named after Marcel Janco , in Ein Hod , Israel While broadly based , the movement was unstable . By 1924 in Paris , Dada was melding into Surrealism , and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements , including Surrealism , social realism and other forms of modernism . Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of postmodern art . By the dawn of the Second World War , many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States . Some died in death camps under Adolf Hitler , who actively persecuted the kind of `` degenerate art '' that he considered Dada to represent . The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature . Dada is a named influence and reference of various anti-art and political and cultural movements , including the Situationist International and culture jamming groups like the Cacophony Society . Upon breaking up in July 2012 , anarchist pop band Chumbawamba issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement . At the same time that the Z\\u00fcrich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the Cabaret Voltaire , Lenin was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment . Tom Stoppard used this coincidence as a premise for his play Travesties , which includes Tzara , Lenin , and James Joyce as characters . French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue - in - cheek L\\u00e9nine Dada . The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002 , by a group proclaiming themselves Neo-Dadaists , led by Mark Divo . The group included Jan Thieler , Ingo Giezendanner , Aiana Calugar , Lennie Lee , and Dan Jones . After their eviction , the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada . The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum . Several notable retrospectives have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society . In 1967 , a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris . In 2006 , the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the Centre Pompidou in Paris . The LTM label has released a large number of Dada - related sound recordings , including interviews with artists such as Tzara , Picabia , Schwitters , Arp , and Huelsenbeck , and musical repertoire including Satie , Ribemont - Dessaignes , Picabia , and Nelly van Doesburg . Art Techniques developed Collage The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items , but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets , maps , plastic wrappers , etc. to portray aspects of life , rather than representing objects viewed as still life . Cut - up technique Cut - up technique is an extension of collage to words themselves , Tristan Tzara describes this in the Dada Manifesto : TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM Take a newspaper . Take some scissors . Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem . Cut out the article . Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag . Shake gently . Next take out each cutting one after the other . Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag . The poem will resemble you . And there you are -- an infinitely original author of charming sensibility , even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd . Photomontage The Dadaists -- the `` monteurs '' -- used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media . A variation on the collage technique , photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press . In Cologne , Max Ernst used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war . Raoul Hausmann , Mechanischer Kopf ( Mechanical Head ) , c. 1920 Raoul Hausmann , ABCD , a photomontage from 1923 -- 24 Assemblage The assemblages were three - dimensional variations of the collage -- the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless pieces of work including war objects and trash . Objects were nailed , screwed or fastened together in different fashions . Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall . Readymades Marcel Duchamp began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art , which he called `` readymades '' . He would add signatures and titles to some , converting them into artwork that he called `` readymade aided '' or `` rectified readymades '' . Duchamp wrote : `` One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the ' readymade . ' That sentence , instead of describing the object like a title , was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal . Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations , would be called ' readymade aided . ' '' One such example of Duchamp 's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back , signed `` R. Mutt '' , titled Fountain , and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year , though it was not displayed .

Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long - established convention that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable , a privilege maintained for life . The current , and 23rd , Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party 's Justin Trudeau , who was appointed on November 4 , 2015 , by Governor General David Johnston , following the general election that took place that year . Contents 1 Origin of the office 2 Qualifications and selection 3 Term of office 4 Role and authority 5 Privileges 6 Style of address 7 Prime Minister - designate of Canada 8 Activities post-commission 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References 12 External links Origin of the office The position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act , 1982 , and the Letters Patent , 1947 issued by King George VI . The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom . Qualifications and selection The prime minister , along with the other ministers in cabinet , is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch . However , by the conventions of responsible government , designed to maintain administrative stability , the governor general will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support , or confidence , of a majority of the directly elected members of the House of Commons ; as a practical matter , this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority , or a very large plurality , of Members of Parliament . While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament , for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly . However , in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister . Two former prime ministers -- Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell -- served in the 1890s while members of the Senate . Both , in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate , succeeded prime ministers who had died in office -- John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894 . That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario . Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible . For example , William Lyon Mackenzie King , after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election , briefly `` governed from the hallway '' before winning a by - election a few weeks later . Similarly , John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons ; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power . Turner was the last serving prime minister to not hold a commons seat . Sir John A. Macdonald , the first Prime Minister of Canada Should a serving prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature , or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat , the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by - election . A safe seat is usually chosen ; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party 's new leader in the by - election , the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention . However , if the governing party selects a new leader shortly before an election is due , and that new leader is not a member of the legislature , he or she will normally await the upcoming election before running for a seat in parliament . In a poll conducted by Ipsos - Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on December 4 , 2008 , it was found that 51 % of the sample group thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians . Term of office The Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty 's pleasure , meaning the post does not have a fixed term . Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general , the prime minister remains in office until he or she resigns , is dismissed , or dies . The lifespan of parliament was limited by the constitution to five years and , though the governor general may still , on the advice of the prime minister , dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act ; the King -- Byng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the governor general deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister 's request for a general vote . As of 2007 , with an amendment to the Elections Act , Section 56.1 was changed to limit the term of a majority government to four years , with election day being set as the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year after the previous polling date . Following parliamentary dissolution , the prime minister must run in the resulting general election if he or she wishes to maintain a seat in the House of Commons . Should the prime minister 's party subsequently win a majority of seats in the House of Commons , it is unnecessary to re-appoint the prime minister or again swear him or her into office . If , however , an opposition party wins a majority of seats , the prime minister may resign or be dismissed by the governor general . Should the prime minister 's party achieve a minority while an opposition party wins a plurality , the prime minister can attempt to maintain the confidence of the House by forming a coalition with other minority parties . This option was last entertained in 1925 . Role and Authority Further information : Queen 's Privy Council for Canada Canada 's Prime Ministers during its first century . Because the prime minister is , in practice , the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government , he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada 's head of state , when , in fact , that post is held by the Canadian monarch , represented by the governor general . The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions . Further , the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative process -- with the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinet -- and the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces . William Lyon Mackenzie King , the 10th Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau is credited with , throughout his tenure as prime minister between 1968 and 1984 , consolidating power in the PMO , which is itself filled by political and administrative staff selected at the prime minister 's discretion and unaccountable to parliament . At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st , analysts -- such as Jeffrey Simpson , Donald Savoie , Andrew Coyne , and John Gomery -- argued that both parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power ; Savoie wrote : `` The Canadian prime minister has little in the way of institutional check , at least inside government , to inhibit his ability to have his way . '' Indeed , the position has been described as undergoing a `` presidentialisation '' , to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state . Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson alluded to what she saw as `` an unspoken rivalry '' that had developed between the prime minister and the Crown . It has been theorized that such is the case in Canada as its parliament is less influential on the executive than in other countries with Westminster parliamentary systems ; particularly , Canada has fewer MPs , a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election , and an Americanised system for selecting political party leaders , leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus , as is the case in the United Kingdom . There do exist checks on the prime minister 's power : the commons may revoke its confidence in an incumbent prime minister and Cabinet or caucus revolts can quickly bring down a serving premier and even mere threats of such action can persuade or compel a prime minister to resign his post , as happened with Jean Chr\\u00e9tien . The Reform Act , 2014 , codifies the process by which a caucus may trigger a party leadership review and , if necessary , chose an interim leader , thereby making a prime minister more accountable to the MPs in his or her party . Caucuses may choose to follow these rules , though the decision would be made by recorded vote , thereby subjecting the party 's choice to public scrutiny . The Senate may delay or impede legislation put forward by the Cabinet , such as when Brian Mulroney 's bill creating the Goods and Services Tax came before the upper chamber and , given Canada 's federal nature , the jurisdiction of the federal government is limited to areas prescribed by the constitution . Further , as executive power is constitutionally vested in the monarch , meaning the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of its ministers , the sovereign 's supremacy over the prime minister in the constitutional order is thus seen as a `` rebuff to the pretensions of the elected : As it has been said , when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen , he bows before us . '' Either the sovereign or his or her governor general may therefore oppose the prime minister 's will in extreme , crisis situations . Near the end of her time as governor general , Adrienne Clarkson stated : `` My constitutional role has lain in what are called ' reserve powers ' : making sure that there is a prime minister and a government in place , and exercising the right ' to encourage , to advise , and to warn ' Without really revealing any secrets , I can tell you that I have done all three . '' Privileges 24 Sussex Drive , the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada Two official residences are provided to the prime minister -- 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa and Harrington Lake , a country retreat in Gatineau Park -- as well an office in the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council , across from Parliament Hill . For transportation , the prime minister is granted an armoured car and shared use of two official aircraft -- a CC - 150 Polaris for international flights and a Challenger 601 for domestic trips . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also furnish constant personal security for the prime minister and his or her family . All of the aforementioned is supplied by the Queen - in - Council through budgets approved by parliament , as is the prime minister 's total annual compensation of CAD $347,400 . The Prime Minister 's total compensation consists of the Member of the House of Commons Basic Sessional Indemnity of CAD $172,400 , the Prime Minister Salary of CAD $172,400 , and the Prime Minister Car Allowance of CAD $2000 . Should a serving or former prime minister die , he or she is accorded a state funeral , wherein their casket lies in state in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill . Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals , Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians . John Thompson also died outside Canada , at Windsor Castle , where Queen Victoria permitted his lying - in - state before his body was returned to Canada for a state funeral in Halifax . The mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada , applied to the arms of prime ministers who pursue them In earlier years , it was traditional for the monarch to bestow a knighthood on newly appointed Canadian prime ministers . Accordingly , several carried the prefix Sir before their name ; of the first eight premiers of Canada , only Alexander Mackenzie refused the honour of a knighthood from Queen Victoria . Following the 1919 Nickle Resolution , however , it was against non-binding policy for the sovereign to grant such honorific titles to Canadians ; the last prime minister to be knighted was Sir Robert Borden , who was premier at the time the Nickle Resolution was debated in the House of Commons . Still , Bennett was in 1941 , six years after he stepped down as prime minister , elevated to the peerage by King George VI as Viscount Bennett , of Mickleham in the County of Surrey and of Calgary and Hopewell in the Dominion of Canada . The Canadian Heraldic Authority has granted former prime ministers an augmentation of honour on the personal coat of arms of those who pursued them . The heraldic badge , referred to by the CHA as the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada , consists of four red maple leaves joined at the stem on a white field ; the augmentation has , so far , been granted either as a canton sinister or centred in the chief . To date , former prime ministers Joe Clark , Pierre Trudeau , John Turner , Brian Mulroney , and Kim Campbell were granted arms with the augmentation . Style of address Kim Campbell , the 19th Prime Minister of Canada and only female and British Columbia - born individual to hold the office Canada continues the Westminster tradition of using the title Prime Minister when one is speaking to the federal head of government directly ; this is in contrast to the United States protocol of addressing the federal head of government as mister ; the Department of Canadian Heritage advises that it is incorrect to use the term Mr Prime Minister . The written form of address for the prime minister should use his or her full parliamentary title : The Right Honourable , , Prime Minister of Canada . However , while in the House of Commons during Question Period , other members of parliament may address the prime minister as The Right Honourable , Member for or simply The Right Honourable Prime Minister . Former prime ministers retain the prefix The Right Honourable for the remainder of their lives ; should they remain sitting MPs , they may be referred as The Right Honourable Member for or by their portfolio title , as in The Right Honourable Minister of National Defence . In the decades following Confederation , it was common practice to refer to the prime minister as Premier of Canada , a custom that continued until the First World War , around the time of Robert Borden 's premiership . While contemporary sources will still speak of early prime ministers of Canada as premier , the modern practice is such that the federal head of government is known almost exclusively as the prime minister , while the provincial and territorial heads of government are termed premiers ( save for within Quebec and New Brunswick , where the premiers are addressed in French as Premier ministre du , literally translated as Prime Minister of ) . Prime minister - designate of Canada Further information : Prime minister - designate The Prime Minister -- designate of Canada refers to the person who has been designated as the future prime minister by the Governor General , after either winning a general election , forming a confidence and supply government , or forming an coalition government . The term does not apply to incumbent prime ministers . Activities post-commission After exiting office , former prime ministers of Canada have engaged in various pursuits . Some remained in politics : Bowell continued to serve as a senator , Stephen Harper returned to the House of Commons as a backbench Member of Parliament , and Bennett moved to the United Kingdom after being elevated to the House of Lords . A number led Her Majesty 's Loyal Opposition in the Canadian parliament : John A. Macdonald , Arthur Meighen , Mackenzie King , and Pierre Trudeau , all before being re-appointed as prime minister ; Alexander Mackenzie and John Diefenbaker , both prior to sitting as regular Members of Parliament until their deaths ; Wilfrid Laurier dying while still in the post ; and Charles Tupper , Louis St. Laurent , and John Turner , each before they returned to private business . Meighen was also appointed to the Senate following his second period as prime minister , but resigned his seat to seek re-election and moved to private enterprise after failing to win a riding . Following Meighen into civilian life were : Robert Borden , who served as Chancellor of Queen 's and McGill Universities , as well as working in the financial sector ; Lester B. Pearson , who acted as Chancellor of Carleton University ; Joe Clark and Kim Campbell , who became university professors , Clark also consultant and Campbell working in international diplomacy and as the director of private companies and chairperson of interest groups ; while Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chr\\u00e9tien returned to legal practice . Former prime ministers also commonly penned autobiographies -- Tupper , for example -- or published their memoirs -- such as Diefenbaker and Paul Martin .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the rebellion . Yielding to political pressure , Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed . A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood its ground , which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname , `` Stonewall '' . The Confederates launched a strong counterattack , and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire , many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout . McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington , D.C. Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties , and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated . The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war . Units were committed piecemeal , attacks were frontal , infantry failed to protect exposed artillery , tactical intelligence was nil , and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively . McDowell , with 35,000 men , was only able to commit about 18,000 , and the combined Confederate forces , with about 32,000 men , committed only 18,000 .

On April 15 , 1861 , the day after South Carolina military forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor , President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States . Earlier , South Carolina and seven other Southern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America . To suppress the rebellion and restore Federal law in the Southern states , Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety - day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000 . He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three - year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000 . Lincoln 's actions caused four more Southern states , including Virginia , to secede and join the Confederacy , and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery , Alabama , to Richmond , Virginia . In Washington , D.C. , as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital , General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellious states . He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans . While the Army `` strangled '' the Confederacy in the west , the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts . The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott 's `` Anaconda Plan '' . Instead , many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond , only one hundred miles south of Washington , would quickly end the war . By July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington . Since General Scott was seventy - five years old and physically unable to lead this force , the administration searched for a more suitable field commander . Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott , General in Chief , USA Cartoon map illustrating Gen. Winfield Scott 's plan to crush the Confederacy , economically . It is sometimes called the `` Anaconda plan '' . Irvin McDowell ( edit ) Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan , 42 - year - old Maj . Irvin McDowell . Although McDowell was a West Point graduate , his command experience was limited . In fact , he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General 's Office . While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase , a former Ohio governor and senator . Now , through Chase 's influence , McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command ( by President Abraham Lincoln ) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia , which included the military forces in and around Washington ( Army of Northeastern Virginia ) . McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia , 35,000 men arranged in five divisions . Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations , McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops . Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments , but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level . He was reassured by President Lincoln , `` You are green , it is true , but they are green also ; you are all green alike . '' Against his better judgment , McDowell commenced campaigning . Intelligence ( edit ) During the previous year , U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington City , including Rose O'Neal Greenhow , a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts . He provided her with a code for messages . After he left to join the Confederate Army , he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her . On July 9 and 16 , 1861 , Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run , including the plans of Union general McDowell . McDowell 's plan and initial movements in the Manassas Campaign ( edit ) On July 16 , 1861 , McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent , about 35,000 men ( 28,452 effectives ) . McDowell 's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns , while the third column moved around the Confederates ' right flank to the south , cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army . He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River , the next defensible line in Virginia , which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital . McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July , but the troops , unaccustomed to marching , moved in starts and stops . Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water , regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks . The Confederate Army of the Potomac ( 21,883 effectives ) under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction , approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the United States capital . McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army . Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson 's 18,000 men engaged Johnston 's force ( the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives , augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes 's brigade of 1,465 ) in the Shenandoah Valley , preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard . Movements July 16 -- 21 , 1861 Situation July 18 Battlefield of Manassas After two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat , the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville . McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army 's rear . In the meantime , McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard , who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run . On July 18 , the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right ( southeast ) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn 's Ford over Bull Run and made no headway . Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard 's assistance if possible . Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon , while Stuart 's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson . Patterson was completely deceived . One hour after Johnston 's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington , `` I have succeeded , in accordance with the wishes of the General - in - Chief , in keeping General Johnston 's force at Winchester . '' For the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly . He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction . If the rumors were true , McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates , instead of 22,000 . Another reason for quick action was McDowell 's concern that the ninety - day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire . `` In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force '' , he wrote Washington on the eve of battle . In fact , the next morning two units of McDowell 's command , their enlistments expiring that day , would turn a deaf ear to McDowell 's appeal to stay a few days longer . Instead , to the sounds of battle , they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service . Becoming more frustrated , McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left ( northwest ) flank instead . He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler 's division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig . Gens . David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford . From here , these divisions could march into the Confederate rear . The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson ( Tyler 's Division ) would harass the enemy at Blackburn 's Ford , preventing them from thwarting the main attack . Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area . Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan , it had a number of flaws : it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks , skills that had not been developed in the nascent army ; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take ; finally , McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston 's Valley force was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard 's men . Prelude to battle ( edit ) On July 19 -- 20 , significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run . Johnston arrived with all of his army , except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith , who were still in transit . Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn 's Ford , and Beauregard 's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville . Johnston , the senior officer , approved the plan . If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously , it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other 's left flank . McDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents , so he called for the balloon Enterprise , which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe in Washington , to perform aerial reconnaissance . Opposing forces ( edit ) Union ( edit ) Further information : Union order of battle Key Union commanders Brig. Gen .

These were : 1st Brigade , under Brig. Gen. Milledge Luke Bonham ; 2nd Brigade , under Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell ; 3rd Brigade , under Brig. Gen. David R. Jones ; 4th Brigade , under Brig. Gen. James Longstreet ; 5th Brigade , under Col. Philip St. George Cocke ; 6th Brigade , under Col. Jubal Early ; 7th Brigade , under Col. Nathan G. Evans . Reserve Brigade , under Brig. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes The Army of the Shenandoah ( Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston ) was also organized into brigades . It consisted of four brigades of three to five infantry regiments each , which totaled approximately 12,000 men . Each brigade was assigned one artillery battery . In addition to the infantry , there were twenty pieces of artillery and about 300 Virginia cavalrymen under Col. J.E.B. Stuart . Although the combined strength of both Confederate armies was about 34,000 , only about 18,000 were actually engaged at First Bull Run . The Army of the Shenandoah consisted of four infantry brigades : 1st Brigade , commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson ; 2nd Brigade , commanded by Col. Francis S. Bartow ; 3rd Brigade , commanded by Brig. Gen. Barnard E. Bee ; 4th Brigade , commanded by Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith .

Tyler 's division ( about 8,000 ) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge . The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems . Tyler 's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike . The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate , little more than a cart path in some places , and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9 : 30 a.m. Tyler 's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m. At 5 : 15 a.m. , Richardson 's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell 's Ford on the Confederate right , some of which hit Beauregard 's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast , alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted . Nevertheless , he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville . Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution . Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack , Ewell , at Union Mills Ford , was simply ordered to `` hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment 's notice '' . Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell , but found himself moving forward alone . Holmes was also supposed to support , but received no orders at all . U.S. cavalry at Sudley Spring Ford An 1862 illustration of a Confederate officer forcing slaves to fire a cannon at U.S. forces at gunpoint . According to John Parker , a former slave , he was forced by his Confederate captors to fire a cannon at U.S. soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run . All that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan `` Shanks '' Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men . Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge , but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints . He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander , Beauregard 's signal officer , observing from 8 miles ( 13 km ) southwest on Signal Hill . In the first use of wig - wag semaphore signaling in combat , Alexander sent the message `` Look out for your left , your position is turned . '' Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill , a low rise to the northwest of his previous position . The Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat 's 1st Louisiana Special Battalion , `` Wheat 's Tigers '' . After Wheat 's command was thrown back , and Wheat seriously wounded , Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow , bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men . They successfully slowed Hunter 's lead brigade ( Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside ) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young 's Branch , at the northern end of Henry House Hill . One of Tyler 's brigade commanders , Col. William Tecumseh Sherman , crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders . This surprise attack , coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj . George Sykes , collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11 : 30 a.m. , sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 4 , Additional Map 5 , Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7 . ) Noon phase ( edit ) Henry House Hill ( edit ) As they retreated from their Matthews Hill position , the remainder of Evans 's , Bee 's , and Bartow 's commands received some cover from Capt . John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6 - pounder guns , who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill . They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard , who had just arrived from Johnston 's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm , `` Portici '' . Fortunately for the Confederates , McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately , choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts . James B. Ricketts ( Battery I , 1st U.S. Artillery ) and Charles Griffin ( Battery D , 5th U.S. ) from Dogan 's Ridge . Attacks on Henry House Hill , noon -- 2 p.m Union retreat , after 4 p.m. Brig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson 's Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon , accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton 's Legion , and Col. J.E.B. Stuart 's cavalry . The Hampton Legion , some 600 men strong , managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman 's advancing brigade . Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with , however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle . If so , they would have been the only foreign - made weapons on the field . The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton 's musket fire and began to disintegrate . Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel , James Cameron , and remarked `` Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they wo n't follow him . '' Shortly afterwards , Cameron , the brother of US Senator Simon Cameron , was fatally wounded . It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day , although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York . Jackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill , where they were shielded from direct fire , and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line , which he posted on the crest of the hill ; as the guns fired , their recoil moved them down the reverse slope , where they could be safely reloaded . Meanwhile , McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan 's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support . Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards ( 270 m ) against Jackson 's 13 . Unlike many engagements in the Civil War , here the Confederate artillery had an advantage . The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges , with many shots fired over the head of their targets . Ruins of Judith Henry 's house , `` Spring Hill '' , after the battle Postwar house on site of Judith Henry house in Manassas Judith Henry grave One of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry , an 85 - year - old widow and invalid , who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House . As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire , he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building . A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow 's feet and inflicted multiple injuries , from which she died later that day . `` The Enemy are driving us '' , Bee exclaimed to Jackson . Jackson , a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute , is said to have replied , `` Then , Sir , we will give them the bayonet . '' Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting , `` There is Jackson standing like a stone wall . Let us determine to die here , and we will conquer . Rally behind the Virginians . '' This exclamation was the source for Jackson 's ( and his brigade 's ) nickname , `` Stonewall '' . Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day , thus it is unclear exactly what he meant , moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle . Col. States Rights Gist , serving as Bee 's aide - de-camp , took command of the brigade . Major Burnett Rhett , chief of staff to General Johnston , claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson 's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee 's and Bartow 's brigades while they were under heavy pressure . Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee 's statement was meant to be pejorative : `` Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall ! '' Artillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line , hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates . At approximately 3 p.m. , these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia , whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms , causing Griffin 's commander , Maj . William F. Barry , to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them . Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart 's cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment ( Ellsworth 's Fire Zouaves ) , which was supporting the battery , killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry . Capitalizing on this success , Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts 's guns and they were captured as well . As additional Federal infantry engaged , the guns changed hands several times . Capture of Ricketts ' Battery , painting by Sidney E. King , National Park Service The capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle . Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill , outnumbering the Confederates two to one , no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously . Jackson continued to press his attacks , telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry , `` Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards ! Then fire and give them the bayonet ! And when you charge , yell like furies ! '' For the first time , Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell . At about 4 p.m. , the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke 's brigade . To the west , Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard 's brigade from Heintzelman 's division . Also at 4 p.m. , two Confederate brigades - Col. Jubal Early 's , which had moved from the Confederate right , and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith 's ( commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded ) , which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley -- crushed Howard 's brigade . Beauregard ordered his entire line forward . At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell 's army was disintegrating . Thousands , in large and small groups or as individuals , began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville . McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers , but most had had enough . Unable to stop the mass exodus , McDowell gave orders for Porter 's regular infantry battalion , near the intersection of the turnpike and Manassas - Sudley Road , to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew . The unit briefly held the crossroads , then retreated eastward with the rest of the army . McDowell 's force crumbled and began to retreat . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 8 , Additional Map 9 , Additional Map 10 , Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12 . ) Union retreat ( edit ) The retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings , but it was poorly managed by the Union officers . A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell 's force . As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville , discarding their arms and equipment , McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles 's division to act as a rear guard , but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington . In the disorder that followed , hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner . Wagons and artillery were abandoned , including the 30 - pounder Parrott rifle , which had opened the battle with such fanfare . Expecting an easy Union victory , the wealthy elite of nearby Washington , including congressmen and their families , had come to picnic and watch the battle . When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder , the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages . Since their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well , Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage , despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis , who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating . An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank , using the brigades of Brig . Gens . Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet , was a failure . The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham 's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard , and found that Richardson 's brigade blocked the road to Centreville , he called off the pursuit . In Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory . Instead , a telegram arrived stating `` General McDowell 's army in full retreat through Centreville . The day is lost . Save Washington and the remnants of this army . '' The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital . From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond , `` We have won a glorious but dear - bought victory . Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued . '' Aftermath ( edit ) Brief observations ( edit ) First Bull Run was a clash between relatively large , ill - trained bodies of recruits , led by inexperienced officers . Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively ; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle , only 18,000 had actually been engaged . Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield , he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades , instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole . Other factors contributed to McDowell 's defeat : Patterson 's failure to hold Johnston in the valley ; McDowell 's two - day delay at Centreville ; allowing Tyler 's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman ; and the 2 1 / 2 - hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews ' Hill , which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill . On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level , generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves . Johnston 's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory . Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time , almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle . After reaching Manassas Junction , Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard , but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive . Jackson and Bee 's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle ; Jackson 's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50 % casualties . Detailed casualties ( edit ) Bull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point . Union casualties were 460 killed , 1,124 wounded , and 1,312 missing or captured ; Confederate casualties were 387 killed , 1,582 wounded , and 13 missing . Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron , brother of President Lincoln 's first Secretary of War , Simon Cameron . Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow , who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War . General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day . Compared to later battles , casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy . Both Union and Confederate killed , wounded , and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each . Two Confederate brigade commanders , Jackson and Edmund Kirby - Smith , were wounded in the battle . No Union officers above the regimental level were killed ; two division commanders ( Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter ) , and one brigade commander ( Orlando Willcox ) were wounded .

We are utterly and disgracefully routed , beaten , whipped by secessionists . -- Union diarist George Templeton Strong If the war had turned out to be of short duration , Bull Run would have been a disaster for the Union . But if , as now seemed more plausible , a long and nasty war was inevitable , that battle had a curiously salutary effect for the Union side . It provided a wake - up call for those optimists -- like Seward or even Lincoln -- who had hoped for or counted on a quick result . -- David Detzer , Donnybrook Bull Run was a turning point in the American Civil War ... in the sense that the battle struck with impelling force upon public opinion at home and abroad , upon Congress , and upon the Commander - in - chief . It framed new patterns of thought and led to far - reaching changes in the conduct of the war . The failure at Bull Run inspired a second Northern rising . Volunteering accelerated , 90 - day men reenlisted , states rushed fresh regiments forward in plenitude ... As they realized victory would not come readily , a new mood fastened upon Northerners . An iron resolve entered the Northern soul ... -- James A. Rawley , Turning Points of the Civil War Effect on the Union and subsequent events ( edit ) Union forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington , D.C. , with very little standing in their way . On July 24 , Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe ascended in the balloon Enterprise to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax . He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces , but was forced to land in Confederate territory . It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters . He reported that his observations `` restored confidence '' to the Union commanders . The Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated . Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined . On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service . On July 25 , eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War , Simon Cameron , for federal service in either Patterson 's or McDowell 's command arrived in Washington , D.C. , and were finally accepted . Three months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another , smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball 's Bluff , near Leesburg , Virginia . The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball 's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs . Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later , at the Second Battle of Bull Run . Effect on the Confederacy ( edit ) The reaction in the Confederacy was more muted . There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory , the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well . Once the euphoria of victory had worn off , Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers . Beauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army . Stonewall Jackson , arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory , received no special recognition , but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign . Privately , Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory . Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow : `` Our President and our General direct me to thank you . We rely upon you for further information . The Confederacy owes you a debt . ( Signed ) JORDAN , Adjutant - General . '' The battle also had long - term psychological consequences . The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces , while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union . In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one - sided outcome `` proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy '' . Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation , James M. McPherson has argued that the esprit de corps attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory , together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders , also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months . Confederate victory : turning point of the American Civil War ( edit ) Further information : Turning point of the American Civil War § Confederate victory in First Battle of Bull Run ( July 1861 ) `` Bull Run '' vs. `` Manassas '' ( edit ) The name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861 . The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting ; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms . The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park , but the Union name ( Bull Run ) also has widespread currency in popular literature . Confusion between the battle flags ( edit ) Battlefield confusion between the battle flags , especially the similarity of the Confederacy 's `` Stars and Bars '' and the Union 's `` Stars and Stripes '' when fluttering , led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag , which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general . Conclusions ( edit ) First Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle , and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict . The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men . One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run , now combat veterans , would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run / Manassas .

Reviews `` The Turning Point '' received positive reviews . Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3 / 4 saying that ultimately , the episode was strong just not outstanding . `` A solid episode moves the plot as characters examine their futures and learn about new threats in town .

'' Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5 / 4 saying that it was the one who made her a convert when she first watched the show . `` Looking back , I think the past five episodes have been pretty darn awesome .

I do n't know how I 'm going to deal with the show 's hiatus for two long months , let alone waiting that long to find out what was coming for Elena . Or , who Alaric is ; did he kill Logan to protect Jenna , eliminate a problem - causing newborn , or something more insidious ? '' Lucia from Heroine TV also wrote a good review saying : `` ... the plot twists keep on coming in this increasingly mythology - driven show . Last night 's episode was no exception , as we were treated to one surprise after another , culminating in a seemingly dire cliffhanger . '' Tiffany Vogt from The TV Watchtower stated that the episode has a little bit of everything for everyone . `` This was indeed the turning point for everyone . It was no longer a show about the discovery of vampires . This is now a story about how virtually everyone knows there are vampires and how they interact with them . '' Notes In next episodes we learn that once all the people who live in a house die , vampires can entry without an invitation . In this episode though , Logan says that he ca n't get into his house since he was living alone and there is no one to invite him in . Logan should n't have an issue getting into his house . This was the mid-season finale episode before the show goes on a two - month hiatus .\""

Looking to expand the game , McMillen and Himsl discovered limitations on Flash that made expansion difficult . Though they were able to incorporate more content through the Wrath of the Lamb expansion , McMillen had to forego a second planned expansion due to the Flash limitations . After the release of the original game , McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis , a development and publishing studio that had helped to bring personal computer games Cave Story and VVVVVV to consoles . Rodriguez offered Nicalis ' services to help port The Binding of Isaac to consoles . McMillen was interested but required that they needed to recreate the game outside of Flash to incorporate the additional material he had to forego previously , and to fix some additional bugs found since release .\""
